# Toy Swift Neural Network [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pbardea/swiftneuralnet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pbardea/swiftneuralnet)

I made a simple neural network strongly based off [this blog post](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).

To run, run the NNTests class in NNTests.swift.

Note: Also want to build a simple linear algebra library to use, but may spin that off as a sepearate project since extending a specific type of arrays seems to be a pain in Swift.
